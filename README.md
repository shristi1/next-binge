# Next Binge?!

Form: Website

## Description
Have you ever pulled up Netflix and stared blankly at the screen as trailers you don’t want to watch auto play in front of you? You’ve watched just about everything and now life is boring. Introducing: Next Binge (TM)! Take our hassle-free quiz to get a personalized recommendation for what TV show you should watch next (available for all major streaming platforms). Take the bored out of binge!

## 110 Programming Concepts Used
- APIs: to pull data about tv shows based on search queries like genre and streaming platform
- Dictionaries and Lists: storing tv shows into a database after they are pulled from the API
- For in loops: sorting through data and filtering into new list based on number of seasons; also for iterating through list items in Jinja to present them in an ordered list on the website

## Challenges Overcome / New Concepts Learned
- It was difficult to find an API that had all the data we needed to make our website work. Once we found the right API, it was challenging to extract the data we needed and put it into a form that was useful for analysis. However, we feel this experiece helped us better understand the ins and outs of lists and dictionaries, esepecially as they relate to json objects.
- This was our first use of Jinja and most of our first experiences with Flask and APIs so it was quite fulfilling to create a fully working application.

## Team Members
Shristi Sharma, Naomi Ovrutsky, Samuel Osei

Every member equally contributed to all parts of the project, from idea creation, API finding, data extraction, analysis, and presentation, we all helped with everything and built off of each other's ideas.

## Goals Achieved
We accomplished our goal of creating a Python/Flask website that gives TV show reccomendations based on a user's preferences and API data.

## Future Work
The next step would be to make the website more user friendly (back buttons, cleaner look), add a way to favorite TV shows to refer to later, and increase quiz parameters to get an even more personalized recommendation.
